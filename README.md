# placementChatbot
Chatbot is Artificial Intelligence based software that can imitate a conversation or a chat with a  user  using  various  AI  based  tools  like  NLTK  through  messaging  application,  websites, mobile apps or through the phone. Chatbots are normally used for assistance for services like providing help to customers by answering their queries regarding any topics. The service may include  booking  an  appointment  for  someone  by  interacting  with  the  bit  instead  of  a  real human  which  not  only  saves  time  but  also  ensures  accuracy.  Chatbots  are  increasingly present  in  businesses  and  often  are  used  to  automate  tasks  that  do  not  require  skill-based talents. Most chatbots work mainly on natural language processors and are able to answer the queries of users by choosing the best possible answer out of a set of answers by using various tools  as  intermediaries  (Lemmatization,  Stemming,  etc).  Some  chatbots  also  use  machine learning  models  to  make  the conversation  more  appealing  to  the users.  These  chatbots  are known  as  structured  bots.  They  are  capable  of  learning  new  stuffs  from  experience  and providing individual recommendations and answers to different users.
